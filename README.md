# decoderRing

This is a project I have created for school. It has 3 different functions in order to encode and decode inputted phrases. It inlcudes the caesar, polybius, and substitution cyphers.
This has the ability to encode and decode any inputted string.

IF YOU ARE GRADING THIS:
  Please be detailed about any problems that you find. As I was unable to complete this project to the satisfaction of auto grading. However, all tests pass, and they do not tell me which
  parts are unsatisfactory. Thank you!
